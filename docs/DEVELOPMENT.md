# Development guide

## Project layout

| Folder | What it is |
|---|---|
| `factory-ui/` | Oracle JET web UI (Knockout MVVM, same style as OBDX). Built into static files and packaged into a jar. |
| `factory-server/` | Spring Boot backend (Java 21): REST API, model gateway, database access. Serves the UI. |
| `deploy/` | Linux service file and settings template for installing on a server. |
| `docs/` | Architecture and this guide. |
| `Jenkinsfile` | Jenkins pipeline that builds, tests and archives the jar. |

Backend packages (`factory-server/src/main/java/com/obdx/factory/`):

- `workspace/`: workspaces (one bank's codebase and settings): entity, repository, service, REST controller.
- `model/`: the model gateway. `ModelGateway` is the only way the factory calls AI models; `OpenAiCompatibleModelGateway` works with Ollama, vLLM and private OpenAI-compatible endpoints.
- `common/`: shared exceptions and the error handler that returns problem details to the UI.

Database changes are Flyway scripts in `factory-server/src/main/resources/db/migration/` (`V2__...sql`, `V3__...sql`, and so on). Never edit a script that has already run; add a new one.

## Prerequisites

- JDK 21 and Maven 3.9+
- PostgreSQL 14+ with the pgvector extension
- A model server for real answers, for example [Ollama](https://ollama.com) (optional for building and tests)

Node.js does not need to be installed: the Maven build downloads it into `factory-ui/target/`. For offline or bank builds, point it at an internal mirror: `mvn -Dnode.download.root=https://mirror.local/nodejs/ ...`. npm packages come from the npm registry, or from an internal one configured in `factory-ui/.npmrc`.

## One-time database setup

As a PostgreSQL superuser (usually the DBA):

```sql
CREATE USER factory WITH PASSWORD 'factory';
CREATE DATABASE factory OWNER factory;
\c factory
CREATE EXTENSION vector;
```

Tables are created automatically by Flyway when the server starts.

## Build and run

```bash
mvn clean verify                                  # builds UI + server and runs the tests
java -jar factory-server/target/obdx-factory.jar  # starts on http://localhost:8080
```

Settings come from environment variables (defaults in `factory-server/src/main/resources/application.yml`):

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `FACTORY_PORT` | `8080` |
| `FACTORY_DB_URL` | `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/factory` |
| `FACTORY_DB_USER` / `FACTORY_DB_PASSWORD` | `factory` / `factory` |
| `FACTORY_MODEL_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:11434/v1` (Ollama) |
| `FACTORY_MODEL_API_KEY` | `not-needed` |
| `FACTORY_MODEL_CHAT` | `qwen2.5-coder:7b` |
| `FACTORY_MODEL_EMBEDDING` | `nomic-embed-text` |
| `FACTORY_MODEL_TIMEOUT` | `120s` |

To try the model gateway with Ollama:

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:7b
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

Then open the **Models** page and send a prompt.

## Working on the UI

For quick UI changes without rebuilding the jar, run the server, then in `factory-ui/`:

```bash
npm install
npx ojet serve
```

`ojet serve` serves the UI on its own port and reloads on save. The UI calls the backend at the relative path `api/`, so either open the UI through the Spring Boot server after a build, or configure a proxy for `api/` to `http://localhost:8080`.

Pages follow the JET navbar pattern: each page is a view (`src/js/views/<page>.html`) plus a view model (`src/js/viewModels/<page>.js`), registered in the route list in `src/js/appController.js`. `src/js/services/api.js` wraps calls to the backend.

## REST API (so far)

| Method and path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/workspaces` | List workspaces |
| `POST /api/workspaces` | Create a workspace (`name`, `bankName`, `obdxVersion` = `22.x` or `25.x`, optional `svnUrl`) |
| `GET /api/workspaces/{id}` | Get one workspace |
| `DELETE /api/workspaces/{id}` | Delete a workspace |
| `GET /api/model/status` | Show the configured model endpoint and models |
| `POST /api/model/chat` | Send a test prompt (`prompt`) |
| `POST /api/model/embed` | Embed a test text (`text`); returns the vector size |
| `GET /actuator/health` | Health check |

Errors are returned as problem details (`status`, `title`, `detail`).

## Installing on a Linux server

1. Build with Jenkins (or `mvn clean verify`) and copy `factory-server/target/obdx-factory.jar` to `/opt/obdx-factory/`.
2. Copy `deploy/obdx-factory.env` to `/etc/obdx-factory/obdx-factory.env`, fill in the database and model settings, and `chmod 600` it.
3. Create the service user: `useradd --system obdxfactory`.
4. Copy `deploy/obdx-factory.service` to `/etc/systemd/system/` and run `systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl enable --now obdx-factory`.
5. Check: `curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health`.

## Not built yet

Login and roles (Spring Security), document ingestion, SVN import and code indexing, the screen designer, the agent pipeline and Jenkins build validation. See the roadmap in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).
